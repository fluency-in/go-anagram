# Go: Anagram

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

The tests are written using the `testing` package in the standard library.

To run a test file use the `go test` command:

    go test
